# MenuContextoFlutuante
A study about Floating context menu on Android Studio.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this example I practice how to create and implement an "Floating context menu" on my app.<br>
<br>
<br>
This example was used to learn and practice programming techniques in Android Studio in my postgraduate course at UTFPR(Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná).<br>
